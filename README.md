# Home-Stream
A home streaming app I made for myself and anyone else who wants to use it.

It uses pieces of code from Paul Hudson's hacking with swift series for parsing JSON over a webserver as well as Apple's navigation tutorial for parsing JSON locally.

I also used other pieces of code from some of my old projects and didn't bother renaming the files.

If you wish to use this, just change the webserver URL and path name for the video file you wish to stream.
